WEBPAGE IMPLEMNTATION FROM DESIGNER FILE.

This repository contains the implementation of a webpage from a designer file. The focus of this project is to create the HTML structure, without any CSS or styling. The designer file can be accessed on Figma, and you are encouraged to create an account to view the final design.

IMPLEMENTATION

For this initial project, your main focus is on creating the HTML structure. CSS and styling are not required at this stage. The objective is to build a semantically correct HTML structure that accurately represents the design provided in the designer file.

Completing this project will enhance my skills in implementing webpages based on designer files. By focusing on the HTML structure and adhering to semantic standards, I will strengthen my foundation for future projects involving CSS and styling.
